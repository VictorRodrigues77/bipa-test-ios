## Build tools and versions used

- Xcode Development 14.2
- Deployment Target 15.0
- Swift 5.7.2

## Steps to run the application

- Clone the project using the link: https://github.com/VictorRodrigues77/bipa-test-ios.git
- No need to install any dependencies (cocoapods or swift package manager)

## What areas of the application did you focus on?

- I focused on being fast and precise but with quality, I did the network part completely by hand without any dependencies and I also didn't use storyboard or xib, it was all by hand through constraints

##What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?

- It was the delivery itself, as no layout idea came to my mind, I made it as simple as possible with readable code.
- I used my knowledge of a clean MVVM architecture with Coordinators

## How much time did you spend on this project?

- Between Saturday (22) and Sunday (23) I think I spent something close to 6 hours to perform the test

## Did you make any compensation on this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

- I used Moya a lot to network, I wanted to do it by hand to show other skills I have
- I would like to have implemented the CI and CD part as well, which I know about, but it takes more time
- I would also have implemented a more elaborate UI, but I couldn't think of anything because I also don't have much in-depth knowledge about BTC, but I want to learn a lot hahah

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

- I think the UI part left a little to be desired, as I said I wanted to make it simple, quick and with quality

## Is there any other information you would like us to know?

- I used a 2015 Macbook, with a broken screen and freezing every half hour hahah
- I really liked BIPA and I would like to thank you so far since the chat with Mayara and I hope you like it!!!
